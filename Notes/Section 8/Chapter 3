Packages: 
==========
1. If there is no package statement, the classes are put into the default package, which has no name.
  >> You cannot import classes from the default package.

2. The .class files for any classes that are part of 'mypackage' must be stored in directory called 'mypackage' (Not necessary for the .java files).

3. >> CLASSPATH is the location where java will look for the classes and packages. 
   >> The JRE considers the current working directory (directory from which the command is executed) as its starting point.

4. You can set the classpath while running the java command.
  java -cp “/home/habib” com.habib.Main

5. There should be only one public class in a source (.java) file.
  >> The name of the file should be the same as the name of the public class.

6. >> You can only import a type (ie class or interface, etc).
   >> A package with only subpackages and no classes cannot be imported.

7. Importing a package does not import its subpackages.
