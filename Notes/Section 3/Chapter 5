1. For compound assignment operators: 
  >> x -= y; is not the same as x = x - y;
  >> It is actually the same as x = (data type of x) x - y;

2. Logical AND and Logical OR operators are called short circuit operators because:
  >> AND operator evaulates the first condition and if it is false, it does not evaluate the second condition.
  >> OR operator evaluates the first condition and if it is true, it does not evaluate the second condition.

3. Ternary operator:
   >> Is in the following format: var a = condition1 ? expression1 : expression2
   >> expression1 and expression2 must have the same return type which is not null.
   >> The return type should be compatible with the type of variable a.
