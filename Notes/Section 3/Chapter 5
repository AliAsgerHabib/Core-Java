1. For compound assignment operators: 
  >> x -= y; is not the same as x = x - y;
  >> It is actually the same as x = (data type of x) x - y;

2. Logical AND and Logical OR operators (&& and ||) are called short circuit operators because:
  >> AND operator evaulates the first condition and if it is false, it does not evaluate the second condition.
  >> OR operator evaluates the first condition and if it is true, it does not evaluate the second condition.
  >> To evaluate both conditions, use & and | operator.

3. Ternary operator:
  >> Is in the following format: var a = condition1 ? expression1 : expression2
  >> Ternary operator always returns something (even null).
    
4. Bitwise Operators:
  >> Can only be applied to integer types. ie. byte, short, int, long, char.
  >> The XOR(^) operator returns a 1 when the operands have exactly one 1.
