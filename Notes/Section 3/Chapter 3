Implicit Type Conversion of byte, char and short to int:
============================================================
1. byte, short and char are automatically converted to int when used in an arithmetic or bitwise expression.
2. Implicit Conversion does not work for relational expression.
3. Does not work for increment / decrement operator.
4. Does not work for compound assignment.
5. This implicit type conversion only works for variables and not literals.
Eg. part1()


Implicit type conversion happens from:
=======================================
1. boolean -> Not possible
2. byte    -> short, int, long, float, double
3. short   -> int, long, float, double
4. char    -> int, long, float, double
5. int     -> long, float, double
6. long    -> float, double
7. float   -> double
8. double  -> Not possible
