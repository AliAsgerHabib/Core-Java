Argument Passing : 
====================
1. If a matching method is not available, implicit type casting can take place b/w passed arguments and specified parameters.
For eg. fun(10) can invoke fun(double u){}

2. This automatic type conversions occurs only if no exact match is found.

3. In Java, all arguments are passed using 'call by value'.

4. When an object reference is passed to a method,
  >> the reference itself is passed by use of call-by-value.
  >> However, since the value being passed refers to an object, the copy of that value will still refer to the same object.


Constructors :
================
1. A constructor can only be called by another constructor.
2. To call one constructor from another, use this() keyword.
3. this() should be the first statement in a constructor definition.
