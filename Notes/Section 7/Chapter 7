Object Class : 
================
1. The methods getClass( ), notify( ), notifyAll( ), and wait( ) are declared as final. You may override the others.

2. 
  >> Since arrays are implemented as objects, a reference of type Object can refer to any array.
  But, it cannot be used as an array. 
  Eg.
    Object ref = new int[10];     // This is completely valid
    ref[1] = 1000;                // This is invalid
    System.out.println(ref[0]);   // This is invalid
