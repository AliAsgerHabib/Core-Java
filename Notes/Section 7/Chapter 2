static Members:
=================
1. A static member can be accessed through a class name as well as a reference variable.
Eg. obj.start() or Car.start()

2. static members:
  >> cannot directly call other instance methods of their class.
  >> cannot directly access instance variables of their class.
  >> cannot refer to 'this' or 'super' in any way.

3. Instance members can directly use static variables as well as static methods.


Can static methods be overriding:
====================================
1. Static methods cannot be overriden.

2. Static methods are binded using 'static binding' at compile time.

3. A static method cannot override an instance method and vice versa.

4. If you declare a static method with same method signature in sub class then 'method hiding' takes place (ie. No polymorphism takes place).

Eg. (Worker.java, Employee.java, Main.java)
