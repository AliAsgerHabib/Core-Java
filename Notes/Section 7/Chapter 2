static Members:
=================
1. A static member can be accessed through a class name as well as a reference variable.
Eg. obj.start() or Car.start()

2. static methods:
  >> cannot directly call other instance methods of their class.
  >> cannot directly access instance variables of their class.
  >> cannot refer to 'this' or 'super' in any way.

3. Instance members can directly use static variables as well as static methods.
