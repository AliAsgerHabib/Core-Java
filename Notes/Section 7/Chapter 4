The 'record' Type :
===================
1. Record is Java's implicit Plain Old Java Object(POJO) type.

2. A record is declared as followes : 
    public record Student(String name, int age, int standard, String dateOfBirth) {}
  
3. The part in paranthesis is called the 'record header'. The record header consists of record components separated by comma.

4. Java generates:
  1. Fields with same name and type as the record components.
  2. The field is declared as 'private' and 'final'.
  3. toString() method.
  4. equals() and hashCode() methods.
  5. Public Accessor methods (getter Methods) for all the record components. The name of this method is same as the name of the component.
  Eg. id -> id(), 
      isPositive -> isPositive()
  6. It does not generate any setter methods.

5. Objects of record type can be created and used the same way as that of a class.

Eg.(Student.java, StudentMain.java)
