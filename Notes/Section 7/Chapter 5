Inheritance : 
==============
1. A class can inherit from only one class. So, multiple inheritance is not allowed.
2. A reference variable of superclass can access the object of a subclass.
3. A reference variable of superclass cannot access members which are unique to the subclass and are not a part of the superclass.

Method Overriding :
====================
>> Method overriding occurs only when both the names and the type signatures are identical.
>> If not, then the two methods are simply overloaded.
>> There is no concept of method hiding.
