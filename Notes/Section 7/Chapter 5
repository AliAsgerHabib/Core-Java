Inheritance : 
==============
1. A class can inherit from only one class. So, multiple inheritance is not possible.
2. A reference variable of superclass can access the object of a subclass.
3. A reference variable of superclass cannot access members which are unique to the subclass and are not a part of the superclass.


Method Overriding :
====================
1. Method overriding occurs only when both the names and the type signatures are identical. If not, then the two methods are simply overloaded.

2. The return type of the overriden method can be same or a covariant of the return type in parent class.
  Eg. (Parent.java , Child.java, Worker.java)

3. It can't have more restrictive access priviledges.
  Eg. (Car.java, Mercedes.java)

4. The overriden method should not throw new or broader checked exceptions.
