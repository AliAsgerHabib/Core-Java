===================== 
1. for-each loop iterates through the entire collection and stores each value in element one after the other.
Syntax : 
  for(type element : collection) {}

2. type must be the compatible with the elements stored in the collection.

3. > The iteration variable is “read-only”. 
   > Any changes to the iteration variable has no effect on the underlying array.

4. Useful for collections defined by the Collections Framework.

===================
1. Traditional for loop : for(var i = 0; i< 5; i++) {}
2. Enhanced for loop    : for(var x : arr) {}
