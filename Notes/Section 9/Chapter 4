Varargs :
==========
1. Varargs methods can take variable number of arguments.
Eg. void fun(int ... args) {}
  >> fun() can be called with zero or more arguments.
  >> args is declared as a int[] type.

2. There can be only 1 varargs parameter.
3. varargs must be the last parameter.
4. An array can also be passed in a varargs method.
Eg. part1 

5. If a method without varargs argument exists, and it matches the method call, then preference is given to this method over varargs methods.
Eg. part2

Varargs and ambiguity : 
=========================
1. Varargs can cause ambiguity as sometimes the compiler is unable to decide which function to call.
Eg. part2
