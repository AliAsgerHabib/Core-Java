Traditional switch - case:
============================
1. It works on:
  a. byte, short, int and char 
  b. Byte, Short, Integer and Character
  c. String
  d. enum
2. Value specified in the case statements must be a unique constants (literals, constant expression or final variables).
3. Duplicate case values are not allowed.
4. The type of each value(in case) must be compatible with the type of expression(in switch).
Eg. part1()

Enhanced Switch Case:
========================
1. switch can be used as an expression.
2. switch can return a value.
3. ':' is replaced with '->'
4. No need to use break.
5. default case is compulsory.

6. We can use 1 or more values in the same case statement.
Eg. case "January","February"

7. If case is only returning a value, it can be used like:
Eg. case "January","February", March -> "1st"
    case "April" -> "2nd"
Eg. part2()

8. switch can be used to execute statements as well as to return value. In this case, the 'yield' keyword is used to return the value.
